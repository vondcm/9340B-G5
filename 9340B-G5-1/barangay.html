                <h1>About Brgy. Imelda Marcos</h1>

                <p>There are 129 barangays in <a href="http://caro.doh.gov.ph" target="_blank">Baguio
                City</a> and one of them is the barangay Imelda Marcos. It was named
                after the wife of the late and former president of the Philippines,
                Mr. Ferdinand Emmanuel Edralin Marcos. Mrs. Imelda Remedios Visitación
                Romuáldez-Marcos, now 88 years of age, is a woman who is rich, powerful,
                and owns thousand pairs of shoes. But little did the people know that
                Mrs. Imelda Marcos came from a poor family and worked her way up from
                becoming a saleslady at a music store to becoming a beauty queen
                before meeting the late Mr. Ferdinand Marcos.
                There are no details as to why the barangay was named after the former
                first lady Imelda Marcos, however, if it was not the case, the barangay
                would have been called "La Salle".

                <p>Imelda Marcos is located at Marcos Highway,
                Baguio City. Mr. Ernesto Laguardia has been the barangay captain since
                2002. The barangay has a small population
                (<a href="http://caro.doh.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Barangay-Population-CAR-2011-2016.pdf" target="_blank">1,513 as of 2016</a>).
                There are 2 routes to take to go to the barangay. One is via Route 54
                (27 mins, 2.0 km) and the other is via Military Cutoff Rd.
                (34 mins, 2.6 km).</p>
