                    <h1>Unity in Diversity</h1>

                    <p>When Spain came to colonize the Philippines in 1521, the
                    Spaniards brought with them the teachings of Christianity.
                    Now, majority of the Filipinos are Christians, as a matter
                    of fact, the Philippines is regarded the top Christian country
                    in Asia. The Christian religion in the Philippines included
                    the Roman Catholic Church (where majority of the Christians
                    belong to), and independent Catholic denominations
                    (e.g., Iglesia ni Cristo, Seventh-day Adventist Church, etc.)
                    In addition, there are some parts in the country that were
                    left untouched during the colonization period like the islands
                    of Mindanao where most residents belong to the Islam religion.
                    </p>

                    <p>One of the issues in the Philippines is the discrimination
                    among religious groups within the Christian faith. Since
                    majority of Christians belong to the Roman Catholic Church,
                    they believe that they are more superior than the other
                    independent denominations. However, these independent Catholic
                    denominations believe that some of the teachings in the Roman
                    Catholic Church do not conform to the Bible or the Christian teachings.
                    As part of the community, some residents of
                    <a href="barangay.html">barangay Imelda Marcos</a> were asked
                    on their opinions about their religion and their tolerance or
                    perspective on other religions.
                    </p>

                    <p>Mitch, a millennial resident of the barangay, stated that
                    she belongs to the Roman Catholic Church. She said that
                    although the Christian faith is divided into many religions,
                    she believes that all of these religions still believe in
                    just one God. There were many times when she has experienced
                    discrimination from other religious groups; for instance,
                    she was once asked by someone from the Iglesia ni Cristo
                    why the Roman Catholics believe in Mother Mary, Saints,
                    and religious statues, when in fact this was not taught
                    in the Bible. Being discriminated by being on a different
                    religion felt hard for her, and for this reason, she
                    emphasized on how people should learn to respect another’s
                    faith without judging and condemning one another.

                    <p>Jesus Paolo, a resident of the barangay who converted from
                    Roman Catholic to Born Again, also believes that one must
                    respect another even if they do not belong to the same
                    religion. He has not experience any discrimination in
                    his barangay, however, he feels judged and discriminated
                    by some of his friends and family members back in the
                    province because of his decision of converting to another
                    religion. He said that people naturally believes that
                    their religion or faith is superior to others, however,
                    this should not be the reason to disrespect and
                    discriminate others.

                    <p>According to Kagawad Charito Rivera, the residents in the
                    barangay are respectful to one another despite having
                    different religions. She stated that most residents
                    welcome Jehova Witnesses preachers in their houses without
                    disrespecting them. Moreover, the Roman Catholic church
                    is just near the place of worship of those who belong to
                    the Iglesia ni Cristo to symbolize that there is no
                    separation and discrimination between the two religions.
                    There is also a place for worship for the Koreans just
                    in front of the barangay hall, which shows how welcoming
                    the barangay is no matter what religion and culture a
                    person belongs to. Kagawad Arthur Laguardia also mentioned
                    about how these religion support the community.
                    The parish Church for Roman Catholics have house-to-house
                    biblical readings for the youth and adults on Sundays,
                    while the Iglesia ni Cristo has a day care for children.
                    He stated that everyone is trying their best to preach
                    and show faith to their religion without hurting anyone.

                    <p>Truly, the religious tolerance of the barangay is one
                    that must looked up to. Despite the differences of
                    faith and religion among the residents, they still
                    managed to show respect to one another. Being
                    discriminated of one’s religion is something that
                    can be very hurtful and disrespecting, that is why
                    one must always try to understand each other’s beliefs.
                    Brgy. Imelda Marcos proves the possibility of preaching
                    one’s faith and religion without having to condemn and
                    disrespect each other.
