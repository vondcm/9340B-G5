                    <p>While the age of racism, slavery, and discrimination has
                    passed over the years, one cannot completely say that it
                    has really come to an end. Many cases of racism against
                    immigrants in the United States were reported since the
                    President Donald Trump took over. In addition, despite
                    the increasing support for the LGBT community, there
                    are still some cases of discrimination towards them.
                    It may be that these issues have something to do with
                    one’s norms, culture, and belief system, that is why
                    residents from Brgy. Imelda Marcos were asked of their
                    opinions to have a clearer picture on the said issues.

                    <p>Mitch, a millennial resident, was asked on her opinion on
                    people with disabilities and on the LGBT community. She
                    believes that every person should be treated equally no matter
                    who that person wants to be. As long as the person is not
                    doing something that hurts others, that person is worthy of
                    respect, love, and acceptance. One simple way a person can
                    help in stopping discrimination is to respect one another
                    because when a person feels respected, that person feels
                    accepted by someone. The harsh reality however is that there
                    are still some victims of discrimination for being a little
                    bit different from the majority.

                    <p>Elaine and Jazmin are both residents from the barangay and
                    are part of the LGBT community. Although they consider
                    themselves bisexual, they still choose to wear women clothes.
                    Both of them belong to the same LGBT community, however,
                    only Elaine has really experienced being discriminated for
                    being a bisexual.
                    </p>

                    <p>Elaine strongly encourages other people
                    to take a stand against discrimination. Whenever she was
                    discriminated by others, she felt like she did not belong
                    to the community. Despite being discriminated by others,
                    she said, “I am proud for being what I am, and I am very
                    glad because some people accept us, and they try to open
                    their minds.” Unlike Elaine, Jazmin has not experienced
                    any bullying and discrimination, but she strongly agrees
                    that discrimination must stop because she feels the
                    others who are getting hurt from these.</p>

                    <p>Kagawad Charito Rivera mentioned that everyone should be
                     treated nicely in their barangay. The barangay officials are
                     doing everything they can do ensure that every resident and
                     visitor in the barangay feels welcomed. Although they do not
                     have any projects addressing this issue (except for the city
                     ordinance for PWDs), she said that respecting each other
                     for being who they are is what really matters.
