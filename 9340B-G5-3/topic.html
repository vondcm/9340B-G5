                    <p>President Rodrigo Duterte became the President of the
                    Philippines last June 30, 2016, and he received a lot of
                    criticisms from his fellow Filipinos ever since then.
                    His “War on Drugs” and “jokes” on rape caught the
                    attention of almost all Filipinos, the media and even
                    the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/index.html" target="_blank">United Nations (UN).</a>
                    This got a lot of people thinking about the state of human
                    rights here in the Philippines and therefore, our team
                    visited the <a href="barangay.html">barangay of Imelda Marcos</a>
                    in Baguio city, Benguet and asked the opinions of its residents
                    on human rights in the country.

                    </aside>

                    <p>Charito Rivera, a Barangay Kagawad, believes that human
                    rights are nothing more than respecting each other. She
                    thinks that treating each other with respect and equality
                    is the first step towards upholding human rights. As one
                    of the officials in the Barangay, she stated that they must
                    always make sure that human rights of their residents are
                    not being violated in order to maintain the unity and
                    discipline within the Barangay. She mentioned that although
                    it is difficult to protect everyone’s rights because of
                    cultural differences, there were no cases of human rights
                    abuse in their Barangay thanks to the cooperation of everyone.
                    In regard to President Duterte’s “War on Drugs”, she is
                    saddened of the reported killings and believes that
                    everyone should get a second chance. It might be quite
                    sensible to think that the government is right because
                    some people still continue selling and using drugs even
                    after getting caught, but there were some reports of human rights
                    abuse and killings of people who have been mistakenly accused of
                    being drug sellers/users which should not be taken for granted.

                            <figcaption>Jeny Provides Opinions on Human Rights</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                    </aside>

                    <p>Similarly, Jeny believes that human rights should start
                    with respect. For her, having human rights is important
                    because it allows people to be who they are and who they
                    want to be for as long as one does not hurt the other person’s
                    rights. Although she has not witnessed abuse of human
                    rights in the Barangay, she knows that it is still out
                    there. She emphasized on how glad she was that the abuse
                    towards women is slowly decreasing, and that people are
                    cooperating in order to uphold the human rights in the
                    country.
                    </p>

                    <p>One of the actions the Barangay makes in order to stop
                    human rights abuse is by giving seminars. Lucia Dolteo,
                    an elderly resident of the Barangay, appreciates these
                    seminars because she becomes more aware of her rights,
                    which were not really taught to her before. She believes
                    that by being aware of one’s rights, people can understand
                    and respect each other more despite the differences among
                    beliefs and culture. This is important for people to live
                    their lives significantly and happily.
                    </p>

                    </aside>

                    <p>Issues about human rights should never be ignored.
                    The voice of every Filipino, abused or not, should
                    be heard. Protecting each other’s rights ensures
                    that one can live freely without harming one another.
                    Like Barangay Imelda Marcos, every Barangay in the
                    Philippines must strive to do the same as there are
                    some citizens who are still getting abused just because
                    of lacking awareness on human rights. One does not need
                    to be an official to start an action against human rights
                    abuse. One can start taking action by simply valuing
                    respect towards other people.</p>
